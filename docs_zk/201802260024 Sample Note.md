Niklas Luhmann was renowned for his Zettelkasten and called it his external brain, even went so far as saying it does the writing for him. So far I have not seen a better method for personal knowledge management, geared towards (scientific) writing. If you would like to find out more, I can highly recommend reading [@AhrensHowTakeSmart2017], [@FastZettelkastenmethodeKontrollieredein2015] and checking out [Zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/).

[Zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/) also contains a list of tools for creating a digital Zettelkasten. I prefer [sublime_zk](https://github.com/renerocksai/sublime_zk), an excellent package for SublimeText3. It has been created by this guy:

Exporting a digital Zettelkasten to HTML can be done with [[201802241913]] zk2setevi - The Semantic Text View for your Zettelkasten. It has both:

* a GUI: [[201802241928]] Graphical Tool
* a [[201802241927]] Command Line Tool

The command line tool is simple, too:

```bash
./zk2setevi /path/to/zettelkasten /path/to/output_directory -p pandoc
```
